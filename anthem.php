<h1> THE EAST AFRICAN ANTHEM -KISWAHILI</h1>
	<P class="center" >
The East African community (EAC) was adopted by the East African summit on December 3-2010.
The next step is to grant it legal protection for its operation and usage. The adopted version was in Swahili, the lingua franca of EAC.
The following English translation is not the official translation; it is a literal one merely to appreciate the meaning of the content.
The adoption of an EAC Anthem marks yet another distinct milestone in the integration process. The term “anthem” is currently used more often to denote a song in which words affirm a collective identity, usually expressing attachment to the same nation, institution or cause.
In reference to collective identity, this is expressed in the very first paragraph of the treaty for Establishment of the EAC which states…the people of the East African Community have enjoyed close historical, commercial, industrial, cultural and other ties for many years. The preamble enumerates formal economic and social integration in the East African region commencing with, among other things.</P>

Tuijenge Jumuiya bora.<br></p>
